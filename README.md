# Overview

This is based on a real-worl

# Justification

This is based on a real-world opportunity for legacy modernization in US-Central.

_Please explain why you decided to build the application/demonstration for this project. What inspired you? What problems does it solve or how will it make Presales activities easier?_
_What MongoDB competitive differentiators (developer productivity, resiliency, scalability, etc.) does this demonstration showcase?_

# Detailed Application Overview

_Describe the architecture of your application and include a diagram._
_List all the MongoDB components/products used in your demonstration._
_Describe what you application does and how it works_


# Roles and Responsibilities

_List all the team members and summarize the contributions each member made to this project_

# Demonstration Script

_Demonstration script (or link to script) goes here_

_The demonstration script should provide all the information required for another MongoDB SA to deliver your demonstration to a prospect. This should include:_

* _setup/installation steps_
* _step by step instructions on how to give the demonstration_
* _key points to emphasize at each point in the demonstration_
* _any tear down steps required to reset the demonstration so it is ready for the next time_

# Scoring Rubric Highlights
## Mandatory
* MongoDB version 5.0
* Atlas Search (autocomplete index)

## Optional
* Realm Sync
* Charts
* Realm App Services (functions, auth)

## Bonus Points
* +2 RC - "Flexible Data Model is an excellent fit for this use case since Forms data can have multiple questions and each have a response"
* +2 RC - "Doctors offices do not always have the best internet connectivity, especially in rural and remote areas so offline-first applications are critical"
* +5 Industry Vertical - Legacy Modernization of Health Care
* +3 mLocust - generated sample responses with mLocust
* +3 Cloud Integration - AWS Comprehend Medical integration
* +3 Cloud Integration - AWS Rekognition DetectText

## Core Values
* Build Together - built across the entire US in 2 days 
* Make It Matter - this sort of data entry is a problem in rural and remote areas
* Be Intellectually Honest - we thought we would have gotten more done :(
